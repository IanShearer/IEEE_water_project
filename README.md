# IEEE_water_project

This project is for the IEEE Power Systems club at the University of Central Florida. This code is for controlling the Raspberry Pi 3 and for the GUI to control it.

The .ui file is an xml file created via PyQt5 and is not really necessary to make changes unless you want to make the changes to how the GUI looks
